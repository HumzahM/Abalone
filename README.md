Pytorch ML Data Prediction and Reconstruction on Abalone Data Set

AbaloneAge.py predicts the age of Abalone (the number of rings) based on all of the other factors in the data. The data has extremely high volitality but the algorithm is decently accurate - an average error of about 1.3, which seems to be one of the best I could find 

AbaloneDataReconstruction.py predicts all of the other points in the data based on the rings and sex.

Parallel and High Performance are different experiments on optimizing this for the USC CARC super clusters
